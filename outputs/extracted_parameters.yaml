parameters:
- name: cache_capacity
  description: The total storage capacity of a cache.
  param_type: integer
  constraints: []
  implementation_defined: true
  source_quote: The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block
    are both implementation-specific...
  rationale: Explicitly mentioned as 'capacity of a cache' and 'implementation-specific'.
- name: cache_organization
  description: The structural organization of a cache (e.g., direct-mapped, set-associative).
  param_type: string
  constraints: []
  implementation_defined: true
  source_quote: The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block
    are both implementation-specific...
  rationale: Explicitly mentioned as 'organization of a cache' and 'implementation-specific'.
- name: cache_block_size
  description: The size of a contiguous block of memory locations represented by a
    cache block.
  param_type: integer
  constraints:
  - rule: Must be a power-of-two (NAPOT) value
    is_hard_constraint: true
  implementation_defined: true
  source_quote: Caches organize copies of data into cache blocks, each of which represents
    a contiguous, naturally aligned power-of-two (or NAPOT) range of memory locations.
    The capacity and organization of a cache and the size of a cache block are both
    implementation-specific...
  rationale: Explicitly mentioned as 'size of a cache block' and 'implementation-specific',
    with an implicit constraint derived from the 'NAPOT' description.
- name: csr_address_width
  description: The width of the encoding space for Control and Status Register (CSR)
    addresses.
  param_type: integer
  constraints:
  - rule: Must be 12 bits.
    is_hard_constraint: true
  implementation_defined: false
  source_quote: The standard RISC-V ISA sets aside a 12-bit encoding space (csr[11:0])
  rationale: Directly states the bit-width of the CSR address space.
- name: max_csrs
  description: The maximum number of Control and Status Registers (CSRs) supported
    by the RISC-V ISA.
  param_type: integer
  constraints:
  - rule: Must be 4096.
    is_hard_constraint: true
  implementation_defined: false
  source_quote: for up to 4,096 CSRs.
  rationale: Explicitly states the maximum count of CSRs.
- name: csr_address_accessibility_encoding_width
  description: The number of upper bits in the CSR address that are conventionally
    used to encode read and write accessibility.
  param_type: integer
  constraints:
  - rule: Must be 4 bits.
    is_hard_constraint: true
  implementation_defined: false
  source_quote: the upper 4 bits of the CSR address (csr[11:8]) are used to encode
    the read and write accessibility
  rationale: Specifies a fixed-width portion of the CSR address encoding used for
    accessibility.
